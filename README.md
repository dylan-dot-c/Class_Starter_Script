# Class Starter Script

### **Created by Dylan Heslop**

A simple and efficient starter script to set up your class projects with organized folders and basic boilerplate HTML. This script is perfect for quickly getting started with web development tasks.

## Features
- Automatically creates multiple project folders.
- Generates essential files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `README.md`) in each folder.
- Populates `index.html` with a basic HTML structure, including links to your CSS and JavaScript files.

## How to Use

You can get this script up and running on your local environment in a couple of ways: either by downloading the file or by copying and pasting the code.

### Option 1: Downloading the File

1. **Download**: Click on the script file's name and select the "Download Raw File" icon.
2. **Upload**: Go to Replit, navigate to or create the project where you want to use this script, and upload the downloaded file.
3. **Proceed to Running the Script**: Continue with the steps outlined below to run the script.

### Option 2: Copy and Paste the Code

1. **Copy the Code**: Manually copy the script's contents.
2. **Create a New File**: In Replit, create a new file (you can name it anything you'd like).
3. **Paste the Code**: Paste the script's contents into this new file.
4. **Save the File**: Make sure to save the file before proceeding.

## Running the Script

Once you have the script file ready, follow these steps to run it:

### Step 1: Open the Terminal

In your Replit environment, open the terminal to execute the script.

### Step 2: Execute the Script

You have two options to run the script:

1. **Quick Method**: Run the following command to execute the script directly without changing permissions:
   ```bash
   bash <name_of_script>.sh
   ```
   - This is the easiest method and requires no additional steps.

2. **Manual Method**: If you prefer, you can make the script executable and then run it:
   ```bash
   chmod +x <name_of_script>.sh
   ./<name_of_script>.sh
   ```
   - This method involves setting the appropriate permissions to make the script executable.

   **Note**: This assumes that the script file is located at the root of your project directory. If it's located elsewhere, you'll need to adjust the file path accordingly.

## Additional Tips
- **Customizing Folders and Files**: You can modify the script to add or remove folders, or to customize the contents of the generated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter issues running the script, ensure that the file path is correct and that the script has the appropriate permissions.
- **Delete File**: If the script has ran without errors and everything is pitch-perfect you can simply delete the file and move on. All the best on your learning journey.XD
